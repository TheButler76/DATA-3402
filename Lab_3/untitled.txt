## Week 5 Notes (Basic Probablility/Stats Lecture)

p = probability
p is also called "Frequentist"

1.) Theoretical p of a coin. (theory)
P(H) = 1/2

2.) Empirical p (reality)
P-hat(H) = 7/10

Reasons for empirical:
* Finite Sample Effect
* Randomness: Each toss is independent
* Real-world implications: A coin may be biased

3.) Law of Large Numbers
* limits (Calculus 1)
- lim n -> inf P-hat(H) = 0.5
* Basically, with limits, there are an infinite amount of possibilities ( as n approaches infinity)


We have subsets A and B.

# This means the probability that A and what is not A
A-bar means not in A
P(A-bar union A) =1

a circle with a line drawn through means "no subset"
Disjointed Probability = P(A overlap B) = no_subset

subset A = 1,2
subset B = 1,2,3,4

P(A) < P(B) --> A subset B

Event B: number < 4
Event A: number < 2


P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) < P(B)

AunionB --> A or B
AintersectB --> A and B

Asssuming Independence
P(AintersectB) = P(A) * P(B)


Conditional P = P(A|B) = (P(AintersectB) / P(B))
P(condition|condition)
Given a die,
A: P(1) = 1/6

B: P(num <= 3) = 3/6 --> 1/2

P(A|B) = P(num=1 | num<=3) == (P(AintersectB))/P(B) = 1/3

If AunionB = empty subset --> A and B are independent (no overlap).

P(AintersectB) == join probabaility
P(A|B) = join probability / P(B)
    OR
P(A|B) = join probability / P(A)

Marginal, Joint, and Conditional is important for Bayes Theorem.

Bayes Theorem is just a Conditional Probability.(will copy n paste later).
